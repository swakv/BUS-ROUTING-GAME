# BUS-ROUTING-GAME
A game that helps create a sustainable solution to optimise fuel usage and waiting times across all the bus stops at NTU

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
The problem we want to tackle this hackathon is centered around the theme- Sustainable NTU. Day-to-day activities on campus depend largely on our campus buses.
Almost all students and faculty rely on them to get around campus- on time and efficiently. The system in place now works- but is far from optimal. It strains both the students who spend an unexpectedly long time waiting at a bus stop and the environment which receives the copious amounts of emission released by buses when they are scheduled and functioning inefficiently. 
We would like to produce a visualization of this problem in the form of a game in which a player must optimize the number of buses running at a given moment of time-  to minimize the number of students waiting at a bus stop at a given time as well as the fuel consumed. To do this, we generate a score based on the player’s solution such that a better score implies a more sustainable solution.
